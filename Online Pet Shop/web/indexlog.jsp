            <h2>Dogs</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">The dog is one of the most popular pets in the world (of course cat lovers will argue for cats). Dogs have long played an important role in the lives of humans. It's thought that dogs have been pets for thousands of years. Dogs are often called Man's Best Friend. This is because dogs help man out in so many ways. </p>
                <h2>Types and Breeds of Dogs</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">There are lots of breeds and types of dogs. Dogs vary in size from very small (just a couple of inches tall) to very large (three feet tall). Some breeds of dogs are considered better for indoor or outdoor pets and some breeds are considered working dogs. Jobs that dogs perform include hunting, police work, rescue work, and seeing-eye dogs for the blind. Because dogs are intelligent and willing to be trained, they make a great companion and work animal. 

Dogs are mammals. Different breeds have different characteristics and skills, but most dogs have large teeth, can run fast and jump, walk on their toes, and have strong muscles.</p>

Felinae - These are the medium to small cats like the cheetah, the lynx, and the domestic cat.
All cats are mammals.<br>The domesticated cat is one of the most popular pets in the world. It is thought that cats have been kept as pets for thousands of years. Most people consider themselves cat or dog people depending on the pet they prefer, but many people like both dogs and cats.</p>
                <h2>Types and Breeds of Cats</h2>

            <p class="flow-text">Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and distinctive long ears. There are more than 30 species around the world, and while they live in many different environments, they have many things in common.</p>
                <h2>Types and Breeds of Rabbits</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">Rabbits and hares are in the same taxonomic family, Leporidae, but they are in different genera. There are 11 genera within the family, but the term ?true hares? refers only to species in the genus Lepus; all others are rabbits. Also, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) recognizes 49 rabbit breeds.</p>

            <h2>Rats</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">Many people find that domesticated rats, who are descended from wild Norway rats, are affectionate, intelligent, and sociable animals, not that different from dogs. But others fear rats and don?t want them in their buildings, so they resort to cruel methods of controlling rat populations.

Rats, like mice, are found throughout North America. They are nocturnal, and they can enter a building through quarter-size holes.</p>
                <h2>Types and Breeds of Rats</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. ?True rats? are members of the genus Rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, Rattus rattus, and the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus. Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.

Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a large muroid rodent, its common name includes the term rat, while if it is smaller, the name includes the term mouse.</p>
